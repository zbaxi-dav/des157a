        <p>I enjoyed reading the New York Times article on photography. As someone who enjoys taking photographs in my free time and even enrolled during my undergraduate in many photography courses it was helpful learning ways to perfect my craft and even find ways to tell stories just through a visual. It teaches a way of slowing down absorbing material we see to find the finer details. <br>

        <p>A site that is meant to use image and interaction to inspire visual thinking is Pinterest. It's a social media app and website that uses only images on your feed and allows you to sort them into folders (or boards as they call them) for ideation. Think of it as a digital bulletin board meant for moodboarding. I wouldn’t say its novel as its been around for a good while on the internet but I think its a good example of a website that's stayed a great resource for artists and creatives wanting to gain inspiration. It is highly interactive and the site updates its features to help refine our searches and suggestions to fine tuned ideation. For example I have boards currently dedicated to <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pickled_beet/cyanotype-solarfast/">cyanotype</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pickled_beet/shibori-indigo-dyeing/">shibori</a>, & <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pickled_beet/kantha-sashiko/">kantha</a>. They allow me to put other peoples work on this board to gain inspiration on my hobbies and crafts. I gained visual inspiration for new indigo shibori dyeing techniques, plant placements for cyanotype on clothing, and sewing patterns for kantha and so much more. While it helps with visual creativity and thinking it has some drawbacks. Being a visual only app it can be an accessibility issue for those with visual impairments.

        <p> When coding my own website, I rarely do overlays, and when I do it needs to make a huge impact because if it’s done right it can be successful. That's because I run into overlays multiple times a day on websites but so few I actually engage with. The most common ones we run across are websites asking you to close your adblocker, to subscribe to their newsletter, or now the most popular with California law: to accept cookies. I read the article by the Nielson Norman Group since I am a huge fan of Don Norman! They specifically go over missuses and solve common overlay issues to make the user experience more enjoyable. In fact the issue I brought up, not engaging with popups and overlays is something they mention “we’ve been trained by the many pop-ups and unimportant overlays we encounter on other websites to dismiss a modal window as soon as it appears”.  
        <br>
        The article goes over the 5Ws: Who, What, When, Where, and Why. It asks readers who are making overlays on websites to carefully go through the process of identifying the 5Ws to make sure overlays are used effectively instead of overused poorly. What I learned that I will most definitely apply to my own websites is first to an use an explicit button label. I realized “yes” and “no” or other simple ways of conveying actions can lead to confusion, so instead of “yes” or “no”, saying “yes, cancel my subscription” or “yes, subscribe to the newsletter” is much better. Also instead of those pesky cookie overlays which appear on the bottom, I learned that in the line of sight, smack dab in the middle is much better. I do believe on a personal note that the cookie overlays appear on the bottom for a reason, so you scroll without seeing it fully and just continue using the page because scrolling means you’re "acknowledging letting them collect your cookie data”. So for me next time on my portfolio website where I have an overlay for mobile users, letting them know that some interactive functions might be limited due to being on a phone without hover capabilities, I’ll have it in the middle so they don’t miss it.

        (side note for anyone interested my portfolio is coded from scratch using the same methods we use in this course by using github to host and so many fun interactive features when used on a laptop or desktop. you can check it out here if you wish -> <a href ="www.zahrabaxi.com">www.zahrabaxi.com</a>).

        <p>I enjoyed getting to read about practice of form design. I’ve had to create many survey forms, not out of code but using Google Forms or Qualitrics. I used to be in a Human-Centered Design club so we’d create surveys to post on forums to gain insights for our consulting projects. The part that was the most helpful but also felt like I should have known from the get-go was to add the more complicated questions towards the end. I often want to jump right into things and ask the hard questions first but I realize that might get people to back out early if they feel like they’re being jumped, and will ease in if the opening questions are easy and light. <br>
        The other part I was intrigued about was on explaining any input or formatting requirements. I have not done that before in forms but realize I’ve encountered it. Such as creating a password, most ask for 8-12 characters for a password or have character requirements so it can help users create stronger passwords rather than just one short sentence in lowercase. <br>

        <p>A good example a form to me is from the website goodreads, see below: </p>
        <img src="images/journal1item.png" alt="goodreads" width="600">
        <p>They provide different types of form inputs such as rating, even what “bookshelf” you’d like to keep it in and a review. While it doesn’t follow typical form culture when we think of what a form is, like a survey, it fits a good form structure for reviewing but turning our reviews into a digital archive of our bookshelves. It leaves helpful comments and tips to help users understand the set up and even gives accessibility features. </p>
