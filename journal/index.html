    <h1>Journal Article 1</h1>

    <p>I enjoyed getting to read about practice of form design. I’ve had to create many survey forms, not out of code but using Google Forms or Qualitrics. I used to be in a Human-Centered Design club so we’d create surveys to post on forums to gain insights for our consulting projects. The part that was the most helpful but also felt like I should have known from the get-go was to add the more complicated questions towards the end. I often want to jump right into things and ask the hard questions first but I realize that might get people to back out early if they feel like they’re being jumped, and will ease in if the opening questions are easy and light. <br>
    The other part I was intrigued about was on explaining any input or formatting requirements. I have not done that before in forms but realize I’ve encountered it. Such as creating a password, most ask for 8-12 characters for a password or have character requirements so it can help users create stronger passwords rather than just one short sentence in lowercase. <br>

    <p>A good example a form to me is from the website goodreads, see below: </p>

    <p>They provide different types of form inputs such as rating, even what “bookshelf” you’d like to keep it in and a review. While it doesn’t follow typical form culture when we think of what a form is, like a survey, it fits a good form structure for reviewing but turning our reviews into a digital archive of our bookshelves. It leaves helpful comments and tips to help users understand the set up and even gives accessibility features. </p>
