        <h2>PUMPKIN MOLE ENCHILADAS</h2>
        <h3>The Story</h3>
        <p>This dish started as a way to bring people together when the weather turned cool. I had some leftover pumpkin puree and started experimenting, blending it with the deep flavors of mole. You can even invite guests to be a part of the process, allowing them to fill and roll the tortillas themselves before drenching it in the rich mole sauce. It's a dish that is a perfect addition to inviting fall gatherings.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>For the pumpkin mole sauce:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
              <li>½ onion, diced</li>
              <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
              <li>1 cup pumpkin purée (canned or homemade)</li>
              <li>1 Tbsp tomato paste</li>
              <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
              <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>

              <li>1 cup black beans (cooked or canned, rinsed)</li>
              <li>1 cup roasted vegetables (sweet potato, zucchini, or bell peppers work great)</li>

      <h2>COMMUNITY PIZZA</h2>
      <h3>The Story</h3>
      <p>This pizza started on a night when everyone wanted something different. One person wanted pesto, another wanted mushrooms, and someone else just wanted WAY more cheese. We rolled out the dough together and filled the table with toppings like olives, peppers, and fresh herbs from the garden. It became a small tradition, a make-your-own night where everyone gets a slice that fits them.</p>


      <h3>Base Dough</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2¼ tsp active dry yeast (1 packet)</li>
        <li>¾ cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Sauce</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tsp olive oil</li>
        <li>½ tsp oregano</li>
        <li>Salt & pepper, to taste</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Topping Suggestions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Mozzarella, feta, or cashew cheese</li>
        <li>Bell peppers, mushrooms, or zucchini</li>
        <li>Cherry tomatoes or sun-dried tomatoes</li>
        <li>Spinach, basil, or arugula</li>
        <li>Olives, red onion, or roasted garlic</li>
        <li>Chili flakes or balsamic glaze to finish</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="images/pizzamaking.JPG" alt="Pizza Making" class="making-photo">

      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Activate the Yeast</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Mix warm water, sugar, and yeast in a small bowl. Let it sit for 5–10 minutes until foamy.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Make the Dough</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Add olive oil and the yeast mixture.</li>
            <li>Knead until smooth and elastic, about 5–7 minutes. Cover and let rise for 45 minutes to an hour.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Prepare the Sauce</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>While the dough rises, heat olive oil in a pan. Add garlic, cook for 30 seconds, then stir in tomatoes and oregano.</li>
            <li>Simmer 10 minutes, season with salt and pepper, then cool slightly.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Assemble</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Preheat oven to 475°F (245°C). Roll out the dough on a floured surface.</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of sauce, then let everyone add their favorite toppings.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Bake</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Transfer to a baking sheet or stone and bake 10–14 minutes, until the crust is golden and cheese is bubbling.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Serve & Share</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Slice and serve hot, swapping stories and bites. Every pizza ends up different, but it’s always shared.</li>

        <h2>Beignets</h2>

        <h3>The Story</h3>
        <p>I fell in love with beignets after a trip to New Orleans, but I didn’t learn how to make them until my roommate brought back a beignet mix box from Café du Monde. After that, I went all in. I’d make huge batches and pack them into little boxes to hand out to friends. They’re soft, warm, and completely covered in powdered sugar, which is exactly how they should be. I've outgrown the box mix and experimented repeatedly until perfected a recipe of my own.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>¾ cup warm water</li>
          <li>1 packet active dry yeast (2¼ tsp)</li>
          <li>¼ cup sugar</li>
          <li>1 egg</li>
          <li>½ cup milk</li>
          <li>3 tbsp melted butter</li>
          <li>3½–4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>½ tsp salt</li>
          <li>Neutral oil for frying</li>
          <li>Powdered sugar, for finishing</li>
        </ul>

            </ul>

          <li><strong>Make the Dough</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Whisk in the egg, milk, and melted butter.</li>
              <li>Add flour and salt, mixing until a soft dough forms.</li>
              <li>Knead 3–5 minutes until smooth. Cover and let rise for 1 hour.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li><strong>Roll and Cut</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>On a floured surface, roll the dough to about ¼ inch thick.</li>
              <li>Cut into squares—rustic edges are totally fine.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li><strong>Fry</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Heat oil to 350°F (175°C).</li>
              <li>Fry a few pieces at a time, turning once, until puffed and golden.</li>
              <li>Drain on paper towels.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li><strong>Finish</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Dust generously with powdered sugar and serve warm. Best eaten right away.</li>

      <h2>Naani's Chai</h2>
      <h3>The Story</h3>
      <p>This chai will always remind me of my Naani. She uses Society Tea leaves and never measures a thing and she knows when its the right time based on the color (no timers!). She’d let the water and sugar boil before adding milk, standing over the stove keeping a careful eye. I learned to make it the same way, and now I share it with friends on quiet mornings or long afternoons. It’s a small way to share her warmth with my new found family and communities.</p>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons loose Society Tea leaves (or any strong black tea)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>Optional: a small piece of ginger or a pinch of cardamom</li>
      </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>In a small pot, bring water to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add sugar and tea leaves. Let it boil for about 2–3 minutes until the water darkens and the aroma deepens.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Add Milk</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Pour in the milk and reduce the heat slightly.</li>
            <li>Let the chai heat until it begins to rise, then turn off the stove before it spills over.</li>

      <h2>CHAAT</h2>
      <h3>The Story</h3>
      <p>Chaat is one of those things that everyone makes differently. Some like it spicy, some like it sweet, and some just want all the toppings. I started making it because it’s fun to put out a bunch of ingredients and let everyone build their own. It’s an easy way to get people talking, trying new things, and sharing what they like. There’s always a little bit of a mess, but that’s part of the fun.</p>

      <h2>RAVIOLI</h2>
      <h3>The Story</h3>
      <p>What looks like a fancy meal is actually suprising simple and fun to make. This recipe started as a way to use up bits of leftover fillings like ricotta from lasagna, roasted veggies from dinner, or even mashed pumpkin from fall cooking. Now it’s become something I make when I want to slow down and share food with others. Everyone can help roll the dough, shape the ravioli, or pick their own fillings. It’s simple, a little messy, and always feels like a small celebration.</p>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour (or ½ AP + ½ semolina for more chew)</li>
        <li>¼ tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>~⅓ cup warm water (add slowly; may need a little less)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Filling Ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Pumpkin + vegan ricotta</li>
        <li>Mushroom + herbs</li>

      <h2>VEGETARIAN PAELLA</h2>
      <h3>The Story</h3>
      <p>This dish is the one to make when you want something that looks impressive without taking over your whole night. It tastes as good as it looks and comes together easily, even when you’re juggling other sides. The first time I tried it was at a small dinner where I asked everyone to bring one ingredient to share, like chickpeas, peppers, or a handful of herbs. Now it’s my go-to when I want something that feels simple but still special. It scales up well, it’s fun to customize, and it always pulls people toward the table before it’s even finished cooking.</p>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>¾ cup short-grain rice</li>
        <li>1½–2 cups vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>½ small onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>¼ tsp turmeric (or saffron for a more traditional flavor)</li>
        <li>Salt & pepper, to taste</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Topping Suggestions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Red bell pepper, sliced into strips</li>
        <li>Cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>Artichoke hearts</li>
        <li>Cooked chickpeas</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep the Pan</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a wide, shallow skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add onion and garlic and cook 3–4 minutes until softened.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Build the Base</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Stir in smoked paprika and turmeric (or saffron). Toast 30 seconds to release flavor.</li>
            <li>Add rice and stir to coat evenly with oil and spices. Cook 1–2 minutes until edges look slightly translucent.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Add the Broth & Veggies</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Pour in warm broth (start with 1½ cups) and spread rice evenly. Don’t stir again once it’s spread out.</li>
            <li>Add your toppings: bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, artichokes, and chickpeas.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Cook the Paella</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low.</li>
            <li>Cook uncovered for 20–25 minutes, until rice is tender and liquid is mostly absorbed.</li>
            <li>If the rice isn’t done but the pan is dry, add a splash of warm broth.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Optional: Make the Crispy Bottom</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Increase heat to medium-high for 1–2 minutes to toast the bottom slightly. It should smell toasty, not burnt.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Finish & Serve</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Remove from heat, cover with a clean towel, and let rest 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Top with fresh parsley and serve with lemon wedges.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
