    <h1>Design Comp/Ideation</h1>
    <p>FUN FACT ABOUT ME: i host a lot of dinner parties... a lot. i love especially when guests can be a part of that making process, rather than hovering around me while im cooking. i wanted to make a digital cookbook that centers on food (cultural to my own identity and from identifies i formed later on from friends and my community) that fosters conversation and making as a community. i dont have many photos of the parties themselves since my party groups tend to be ones who try rejecting social media (emphasis on try) so i thought it would be cute to bring in illustrated materials, since i am an artist outside of design practices. </p>

    <p>here are the colors i'm thinking of using and the hexcode roots</p>

    <img src="images/design comp2.png" width="600px" alt="fonts">
    <p>here are some fonts i plan to use, one of them that will be handwritten just for the logo</p>

    <img src="images/image1.png" width="600px" alt="homepage">
    <p>i would be replacing the letters a,b,c etc with illustrations of the food item. the main image would be illustrated, this is just a sketch but it would be a similar layout. <br>also had a random idea to have a music player on the bottom??? idk how to do that right now though but thought it would be cool if there was background chatter for immersiveness </p>

    <img src="images/image2.png" width="600px" alt="homepage">
    <p>clicking the food item would open a card with a recipe, and photos of the making process. there would be speech bubbles on the side that have quotes from the dinner parties that the food may have brought up</p>
